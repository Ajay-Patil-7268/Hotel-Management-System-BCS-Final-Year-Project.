# Hotel-Management-System-BCS-Final-Year-Project.

  

Introduction
 
1.1	INTRODUCTION

The project, Hotel Management System is a desktop-based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities . Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various rooms, employees, drivers and customers make this system very flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single  system. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system.
The Purpose of the whole process is to ease the daily or regular activities of the Hotel Management into an automatic computerized retrievable process. The daily activities includes the Room activities, Entering details of the new customer check in, To allocate a room as per the customer need and interest, Recording the checkout time and details, Releasing or Empty of room and to record the process in a computer system for future
The application of the Hotel Management System bears the following functions to use by the Administrator:
•	Add a new Room
•	Add an Employee
•	Add a new Customer
•	Check room status
•	Check all employees’ details
•	Check all Customers’ details
•	Update room status
•	Update check status 
•	Provide customer bill etc.









1.2	ABSTRACT

In my project “Hotel Management System” I have tried to show how the data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. It manages and maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and drivers in the hotel. The project is aimed to maintain the day-to-day state of admission/vacation of Residents, List of employees, room details etc. Main objective of this project is to provide solution for hotel to manage most there work using computerized process. This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room allocation details, Payment details etc. 
The rooms have different categories like single bed, double bed, Ac_NonAc etc. so their charges and records will be maintained accordingly.
This software has been made in a user friendly interface, so that anyone can add, delete, update the entries and handle all the transactions easily. As a security I have provided Admin username and Password.
















1.3	EXISTING SYSTEM

In the existing manual system a lot of time is spent in communicating the information across different branches. There is a need for an automated system, which has some centralized control over the entire process. Conventional System makes use of huge amounts of paper for recording transactions. All the Hotel records are to be maintained for the details of each customer, bill details, Room Allocation etc.


1.4 NEED AND SCOPE OF COMPUTER SYSTEM

2.2 Requirement gathering
 
Introduction to JAVA
The history of java start with Green team. Java team members also known as Green team. Java programming language is “Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-oriented, Interpreted & Dynamic” Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile device, games,                         e-businesss solutions etc 

Java History from Oak to Java
1.  James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project            in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team
2. Firstly, it was called “Greentalk” by James Gosling, & file extension was.gt
3. In 1995, Oak was renamed as “Java” because Oak it was already trademark by Oak Technologies
Why Java Programming named “Java”?
4. The team gathered to choose a new name. the suggested words were “dynamic”, “revolutionary”, “slik”, “jolt”, “DNA” etc. According to James Gosling “Java was one of the top choices along with slik”. Since Java was so unique name. 
5. Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced called “Java Coffee”
6. In 1995, times magazine called java one of the ten best product of 1995.
7. JDK 1.0 released in (January 23,1996).

Features of Java
 Simple
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. Java syntax is based on C++
 


Object-oriented
Java is an Object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior

Platform Independent 
Java is platform independent because it is different from other language like C, C++ etc. which are complied into platform specific machines while java is a write once, run anywhere language.

Secured 
Java is best known for its security. With java, we can develop virus-free systems.                            Java is Secured because:
•	No explicit pointer
•	Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox

High-Performance
Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because java bytecode is “close” to native code. Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages.

Multi-threaded 
 A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. The main advantage of    Multithreading is that it doesn`t occupy for each thread. It shares a common memory area, Threads are important for multi-media, wed application etc. 






 Introduction of MySQL
 
 
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integritybackups.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation). In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source 
MySQL

MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often. MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications. including Drupal, Joomla, php BB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Flickr, Media Wiki, Twitter, and YouTube.

Conclusion



7.1 Conclusion

In this project I have tried my best to make user friendly software. This software can be handled by any person who has little bit of idea of computers. In this software I have tried to meet most of the requirements of the present hotel management system including maintaining details of customers, rooms, employees and drivers. I also keep provision to update the details of customers, rooms and employees. In my effort I have tried to make my software all the more user friendly but there may some features which I would like to include in my continuous attempts.
•	The ‘Hotel Management System’ simplifies the management process and reduces human efforts. 
•	The ‘Hotel Management System’ is useful to store all records properly. 
•	System is easy to handle and the functions provided by ‘Hotel Management System’ are easily understandable so anyone can handle this software. 
•	The ‘Hotel Management System’ is user friendly as it provides quick access to all the records, fast processing, immediate results with high accuracy and data security. 














7.2 Limitations (Future Enhancement)

The world is changing rapidly and so is the meaning of the Hotel Management System. Today hotel management is not only confined to hotels but has gone deep into tourism, catering, clubs, etc making it a very paying and an exciting career option. 
With the rapid growth of the hotel industry pushed forward by foreign and domestic tourism and business travels, the demand for well trained and quality personnel too has gone up high. India is one of the preferred tourist and travel destinations. Approx 4.4 million tourists visit our country every year. The growth of 20% has been recorded in the tourist and hospitality industry over a few years and more growth is expected in coming years. At present, there are about 200 millions of jobs available in the industry, out of which 20% of the job opportunities are in India.
 The Hotel Management System has a lot of enhancement options. In future more features may be added category-wise. It may try to analyze the user behaviour and preferences and accordingly suggest. All concepts can be applied to make the Hotel Management System more efficient.

There is a scope for future enhancement of this system stated as follows:  
•	Database is to be provided by the means of which user can directly backup though pen drive or through CD. 
•	Provide an on-line facility for “Hotel Management System”. 
•	We can modify this software as to make it client-server multiuser software.
